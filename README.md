# Adventure in Julog
Conversion of Adventure in Prolog into logic programming in Julia (e.g. Julog)

Based on Adventure in Prolog by David Merrit https://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/

Also inspired by the example of Adventure in core.logic, which has the same goal.

First conversion is to try to get the logic to work in Julog https://github.com/ztangent/Julog.jl.  Note: I did not quite finish Adventure in Prolog, so my goal is to get as far as I did in Adventure in Prolog :-)
